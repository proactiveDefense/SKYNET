# SKYNET

SkyTrap is a cloud-based research honeynet that mimics ICS/SCADA environments. A honeynet is a network infrastructure consisting of honeypots, which are computer systems designed to attract and monitor cyber attackers. SkyTrap includes both low and high-interaction honeypots, offering various ways to collect information about threats and attackers. Finally, this project is deployed through Amazon Web Services (AWS) and uses Terraform for a fully automated deployment process.
